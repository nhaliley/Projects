So far everything seems to be working.

I can gen a password and append it to a file. I can then encrypt the file with
a user generated password.

I can also decrypt the file and view it. The content it hashed and with a salt. Sick.

There are a few things I need to consider now...

1. Can this hash be cracked?
2. Malware that steals what has be added to the clipboard?

Things I need to add and work on:

1. After adding onto the password file, there needs to be a way to delete it for
security reasons.
2. Need to format the password file that adds website, email, and password.
3. A backup method for this file. Since users can see this file, what happens
if they delete it? Can we make a hidden backup somewhere secure?
