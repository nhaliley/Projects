Things I need to add and work on:


2. Need to format the password file that adds website, email, and password.
3. A backup method for this file. Since users can see this file, what happens
if they delete it? Can we make a hidden backup somewhere secure?

4. Need to add a way to pass an argument for initial setup. A file needs to be generated and
encrypted prior to running the script.
  python main.py -setup
  which will create a file to append the data into and then encrypt it.
